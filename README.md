# Boids-Simulation
A 3D implementation of the Boids Algorithm, performed by crows in Unity.

Any prefab can serve as a boid as long as it contains the Boid script (i.e. the necessary Boid class).

 - Conrad Parker's page not only provides a nice explanation of the rules, but also
   helpful pseudocode to assist in implementation.  
 - Ben Eater's JavaScript implementation introduced me to the idea of applying non-constant factors to the rules of the algorithm.
